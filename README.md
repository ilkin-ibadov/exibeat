### Exibeat

Imagine David, a music producer, and DJ Sam, collaborating through this app.

### David’s Journey (Producer):

David starts by registering for the platform. After logging in, he lands on his dashboard where he sees options to submit new tracks.

David records a fresh beat and decides to share it with DJ Sam. He clicks “Submit Track,” fills in the track title, selects Sam from DJ list, and optionally writes a short message about the vibe or ideas behind the track. Once submitted, David’s track appears in his list of submitted tracks, and a real-time notification quietly pops up in Sams’s side of app — he instantly knows there’s something new to check out.

David can submit as many tracks as he wants, but for now, he can only add one message for each track, keeping communication clear and focused. This will be replaced with real-time communication between the two sides.

### Sam’s Journey (DJ):

On the other side, Sam logs in and sees a list of tracks producers have sent him, including David’s latest submission. Clicking on a track reveals all details and messages attached.

Listening carefully, Sam wants to give feedback. He types his thoughts, suggestions, or appreciation, and sends it through the app. His feedback is instantly delivered to David.

### Real-Time Connection:

For the next updates we will introduce real-time chat experience. The moment a track is submitted or feedback is sent, their apps will receive instant updates, creating a seamless, live chat experience around each track.

This flow keeps everyone focused on what matters — making and improving music together, with no delays or missed messages.
